# V6Edit

This is a custom tool I've made for modifying VVVVVV levels from a C++ environment.
Most notably I've used this for making [JJJUMP](https://heptaveegesimal.com/2024/jjjump/) and [Minesveeper 37](https://heptaveegesimal.com/2024/36and37/).

**Why not use the VVVVVV source code?**

Me first starting this tool, predates the VVVVVV source code release. But for me personally I still prefer working within this environment custom made to my use cases.

**Why not make VED plugins?**

Because then I'd have to use Lua!

**Disclaimer:**

If you want to mess around with this, I make no promises about it's reliability and will hold no accountability if it corrupts your level files.
I am already aware of this tool not preserving script and trinket order, allthough these have been irrelevant for my use cases.
So far this was primarily developed for personal use.
